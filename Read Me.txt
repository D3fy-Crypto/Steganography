Respected mam

The Code for the Project is a bit a stress test for the cpu So it might take Some Time to run the Code in matlab, 
So please have patience madam,By any chance if this code did'nt run, These are the add ons which are given below I have in my matlab Software
So if any required please download the add ons and run the code
